# Basic OpenAI API Scripts

### Simple Python scripts for getting started with OpenAI's API
- `Chat.py` - For interacting with the GPT-4 and chatting
- `Dalle3.py` - For generating multiple images in parallel via DALLÂ·E 3

## How to Use:
1. Make sure any required packages are installed. You can use `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Currently the only required package is `openai`
2. Add your OpenAI API key to `key.txt`
3. Run a script such as `chat.py` or `Dalle3.py`

## DALLE-3 Image Generation
- Open `Dalle3.py` and edit any settings you want under "User Settings" near the top. Including the prompt and number of images to generate at once.
- After all images are generated and returned, a window with the images will be shown
- Automatically saves the images into an output folder, and records the "revised prompts" for each image (the prompt actually used, that was based on the user-provided prompt)
